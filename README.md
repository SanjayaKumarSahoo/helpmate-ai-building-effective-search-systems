**# Building Effective Search Systems HelpMateAI

## 1. Background

In todayâ€™s digital age, online shopping has become the preferred option for many consumers. However, the vast array of
choices and the lack of personalised assistance can make the shopping experience overwhelming and challenging. To
address this issue, we present ShopAssist AI. This chatbot combines the power of LLMs and rule-based functions to
provide accurate and reliable recommendations during the online laptop shopping experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

The goal of the project is to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately
answering questions from a policy document.

We will be using a single long life insurance policy document for this project.

## 3. Document

1. The policy document can be found [here](Principal-Sample-Life-Insurance-Policy.pdf)

## 4. Approach

The project should implement all the three layers effectively. It will be key to try out various strategies and
experiments in various layers in order to build an effective search system. Let's explore what we need to do in each of
the layers.

1. **The Embedding Layer:** The PDF document needs to be effectively processed, cleaned, and chunked for the embeddings.
   Here, the choice of the chunking strategy will have a large impact on the final quality of the retrieved results. So,
   we need to make sure that we try out various stratgies and compare their performances.

   Another important aspect in the embedding layer is the choice of the embedding model. we can choose to embed the
   chunks using the OpenAI embedding model or any model from the SentenceTransformers library on HuggingFace.

2. **The Search Layer:** Here, we need to design at least 3 queries against which you will test your system. You
   need to understand and skim through the document, and accordingly come up with some queries, the answers to which
   can be found in the policy document.

   Next, we need to embed the queries and search your ChromaDB vector database against each of these queries.
   Implementing a cache mechanism is also mandatory.

   Finally, we need to implement the re-ranking block, and for this we can choose from a range of cross-encoding
   models on HuggingFace.

3. **The Generation Layer:** In the generation layer, the final prompt that we design is the major component. We need to
   make sure that the prompt is exhaustive in its instructions, and the relevant information is correctly passed to the
   prompt. We may also choose to provide some few-shot examples in an attempt to improve the LLM output.

## 5. System Functionalities

- **User Interface:** The ShopAssistAI platform features an intuitive web interface that allows users to engage
  seamlessly with the conversational AI assistant.
- **Conversational AI:** At the heart of this system is the conversational AI, which leverages OpenAI's chat model to
  guide users by asking appropriate questions and discerning their specific needs.
- **User Input Moderation:**  To ensure a secure conversational environment, each inputs are regulated through OpenAI's
  moderation API.
- **User Profile Extraction:** The AI assistant collects vital information during the conversation to
  construct a user profile that accurately represents their laptop preferences, including budget, display quality,
  processing power, portability etc. utilizing OpenAI's function calling mechanism to convert user requirement strings
  into JSON format.

The dataset  [laptop_data.csv](./chatbot/laptop_data.csv) includes rows that detail the specifications of each laptop,
with a concise
description provided at the end of each entry. The chatbot will employ large language models to interpret the
`Description` column and generate recommendations.

## 6. System Architecture

ShopAssistAI operates on a client-server architecture. Users engage with a web interface that is hosted on a server
utilizing the Flask application. This application communicates with OpenAI's API to facilitate conversation generation
and moderation, while also accessing and comparing laptop data from an external database.

## 7. Implementation Details

The Flask application utilizes various functionalities:

- **Routing:** Routing directs user requests to the relevant functions according to the specified URLs.
- **Conversation Management:** Oversees the initiation of conversations, the generation of
  responses utilizing OpenAI's chat model, and the maintenance of conversation history.
- **User Input Processing:** User Input Processing involves capturing user input, conducting moderation checks, and
  extracting user profiles from the conversation history, which includes converting the user input string into JSON
  format through OpenAI Function calling.
- **Recommendation Logic:** It assesses user profiles against laptop data, verifies the validity of recommendations,
  and produces the corresponding recommendation text

  ### Major Functions
- `initialize_conversation()`: Initializes the variable conversation with the system message.
- `get_chat_completions()`: Takes the ongoing conversation as the input and returns the response by the assistant.
- `moderation_check()`: Checks if the user's or the assistant's message is inappropriate. If any of these is
  inappropriate, it ends the conversation.
- `intent_confirmation_layer()`: Evaluates if the chatbot has captured the user's profile clearly.
- `dictionary_present()`: Checks if the final understanding of the user's profile is returned by the chatbot as a Python
  dictionary.
- `compare_laptops_with_user()`: Compares the user's profile with the different laptops and comes back with the top 3
  recommendations.
- `initialize_conv_reco()`: Initializes the recommendations conversation.

  ### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Please ensure that you add your OpenAI API key to the empty text file named "OpenAI_API_Key" in order to access the
  OpenAI API.
